Virtual Assistant Program
Description
This virtual assistant, named Hazel, is a Python-based program designed to perform a variety of tasks through voice commands. Utilizing libraries like pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, speech_recognition for voice recognition, and others like pywhatkit, yfinance, pyjokes, webbrowser, datetime, and wikipedia, Hazel can assist users with daily digital tasks.

Features
Hazel can:

Open YouTube and Google Browser: Responds to voice commands to open YouTube and Google in a web browser.
Provide Date and Time Information: Tells the current date, time, and day of the week upon request.
Conduct Wikipedia Searches: Performs a Wikipedia search and reads out a summary of the search topic.
Internet Searches and YouTube Playback: Searches the internet and plays YouTube videos based on voice commands.
Tell Jokes: Uses pyjokes to tell random jokes.

Speech Recognition Sensitivity: May struggle with short or monosyllabic responses like "yes" or "no".
Network Dependency: Relies on an active internet connection for most functionalities.
Limited Contextual Understanding: Lacks advanced context maintenance over multiple exchanges.
Error Handling: Basic error handling is present, but more robust handling for network failures and speech recognition errors is needed.
Future Scope
Potential future developments for Hazel include:

Improved Contextual Conversations: Implementing a more sophisticated context management system to handle complex dialogues.
Enhanced Speech Recognition: Refining the speech recognition process, especially for short responses.
Additional Functionalities: Integrating more features such as setting reminders, sending emails, or reading news headlines.
User Customization Options: Allowing users to customize settings, voices, and commands.
GUI Implementation: Developing a graphical user interface for a more interactive experience.
Offline Capabilities: Adding functionalities that do not rely on internet connectivity.
